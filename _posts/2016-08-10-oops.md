So my blog sort of crashed and burned shortly after my last post. I ended up messing up a commit and deleting all the css from the site. I didn't fix it because:

 1. From the start of May my day job became the kind of time-sink that meant that the last thing I wanted to do in my downtime was futz around with side projects.

 2. I thought the issue was way more complex than it ended up being. Sigh.

 Never mind.

 I intend to write some long form posts soon about the misty days of 2010, the state of JavaEE back then and what it's like to pick exactly the wrong tool for a project.
